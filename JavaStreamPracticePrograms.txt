In the snippet code, we are taking into account that there might be multiple spaces between 2 words by using the regular expression while splitting.

        if (input == null || input.isEmpty()) { return strings; }

Topic: Convert an array to a list
Topic: Convert an array to a List (resizable list)
Following will be a mutable list.
Method 1: List<String> wordList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(wordAsArray));
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/conversion-of-array-to-arraylist-in-java/
Method 2: (UnmodifiableList)Arrays.asList(<ArrayObjectHere>)
String[] geeks = {"Rahul", "Utkarsh",
                          "Shubham", "Neelam"};

        // Conversion of array to ArrayList
        // using Arrays.asList
        List al = Arrays.asList(geeks);
Since returned List is fixed-size List, we canâ€™t add more element(s). An attempt of adding more elements would cause UnsupportedOperationException.

For getting the max age from the list of persons
Optional<Person> collect = people.stream()
