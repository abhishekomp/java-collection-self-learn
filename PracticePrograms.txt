Topic: Sorting a Map
Topic: Given a Map, we want a list output containing the keys in sorted order
For example, if the Map has key as person name and value as their age, then we want a list having the person name in sorted order

Topic: Count the number of words in a sentence
In the snippet code, we are taking into account that there might be multiple spaces between 2 words by using the regular expression while splitting.

    public String[] getWordAsArray(String input) {
        //Create Empty array
        String[] strings = {};
        if (input == null || input.isEmpty()) { return strings; }
        strings = input.split("\\s+");
        return strings;
        // System.out.println("Count: " + strings.length);

Topic: Convert an array to a List (resizable list)
Following will be a mutable list.
Method 1: List<String> wordList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(wordAsArray));
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/conversion-of-array-to-arraylist-in-java/
Method 2: (UnmodifiableList)Arrays.asList(<ArrayObjectHere>)
String[] geeks = {"Rahul", "Utkarsh",
                          "Shubham", "Neelam"};

        // Conversion of array to ArrayList
        // using Arrays.asList
        List al = Arrays.asList(geeks);
Since returned List is fixed-size List, we canâ€™t add more element(s). An attempt of adding more elements would cause UnsupportedOperationException.
